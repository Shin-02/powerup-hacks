</br>- <b>Clear section headings.</b> Pick a heading (H2, for example) and use it for all the section headers.
</br>- <b>Ample white-space.</b> Especially around the margins.
</br>- <b>Easy-to-read font.</b> We’d recommend sticking to what stands out, but not too much. Do: Ubuntu, Roboto, Overpass, etc. <b>Don’t</b> (ever): Comic Sans
</br>- <b>Pick the right font size.</b> As a rule of thumb, go for 11 - 12 pt for normal text, and 14 - 16 pt for section titles.
</br>- <b>As a rule of thumb.</b> Save your resume as PDF. Word is a popular alternative, but it has a good chance of messing up your resume formatting.

                            <b>Step 1</b> - List Hard Skills with Experience Levels. For each hard skill you list, you want to mention your proficiency level:

As a rule of thumb, you can divide them by:

<br/>
<b>Beginner</b> - You have some experience with the skill, whether it’s from some entry-level practice or classroom education.

<b>Intermediate</b> - You’ve used the skill in a work environment with a good level of understanding.

<br/>
<b>Advanced</b> - You’re the go-to person for the skill in your office. You can coach other employees, and understand the skill on a high level.
</br>
<b>Expert</b> - You’ve applied this skill in more than a handful of different projects & organizations. You’re the go-to person for advice about the skill, not just in your office, but even amongst some of the best professionals in your field.

Make sure to NEVER lie about your skill levels. Otherwise, it’s going to be pretty awkward both for you and your employer.

</br>
<b>Step 2</b> - Tailor Your Skills to the Job. You might have some super rare, awesome skills, but they’re not always going to be useful. For example, it’s awesome that you know accounting, but would you really need it at your new job as a line cook? Exactly!

Take a look at the job ad and list 2-3 essential skills required for the job.

If you’re qualified, make sure to mention all relevant skills with respective proficiency levels in your “Skills” section.
</br>
<b>Step 3</b> - Include Some Universal Skills - “Universal Skills” are the type of skills useful for almost any job out there. These are both soft skills (leadership, teamwork, critical thinking, etc.) and hard skills (Excel, Powerpoint, Photoshop, writing, etc.). Whatever job you’re applying to, chances are, these skills will in one way or another come in handy, so feel free to include them, even if they’re not specifically required for the position.
